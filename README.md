## How to run the app

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mindful-Connect/happly-laravel-challenge
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

### 3. Creating `.env`

Create a new .env file by duplicating the .env.example file and updating the values for your environment. If you are
using SQLite, update the `DB_CONNECTION` to sqlite and set the `DB_DATABASE` to an absolute path to the SQLite file, for
example:

```js
DB_CONNECTION = sqlite
DB_DATABASE = /absolute/path/to/database.sqlite
```

### 4. Generate a new application key by running:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Run the migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### 6. Compile the assets (vite + react) by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 7. Run the app

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Your application should now be running at http://localhost:8000.

### 8. Run the SSR server (optional)

```bash
php artisan inertia:start-ssr
```

üìù Note: No unit tests were written for this app.
